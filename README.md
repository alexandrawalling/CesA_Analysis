#CesA Analysis

This repository contains an R script for creating a tree figure from outputs of RAxML analysis of CesA genes from multiple species of mosses.

##Data

RAxML outputs are contained within the directory raxml_outputs. The output file
containing bipartitions and branch labels should be used in the R script.

Metadata is contained within the file Species_labels_edited.csv . This file contains species names 
and labels for Ppatens CesA genes.

## Script

The R script for this repository is CesATree.R . Paths to specific outputs for RAxML analysis should be edited.
